# Stochastic Stenography

Pelican-powered Jupyter-based super-fun-times blog.

This is the configuration for the blog. It uses the [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) template for the general layout, and a series of [Pelican plugins](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) as listed in the `pelicanconf.py` file. The actual content itself is hosted at the [magsol.github.io](https://github.com/magsol/magsol.github.io) repository and published at [this website](http://magsol.github.io).
