Title: Contact
Slug: contact

There are lots of ways to get in touch with me. [Try this one before any of the others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). If that doesn't work, try the left-hand column over there.

Failing those, here's a semi-exhaustive list of how you can get in touch with me.

### By Email

 - **[squinn AT cs DOT uga DOT edu](mailto:squinn@cs.uga.edu)** for research correspondence, collaboration requests, or anything UGA or otherwise academic related.
 - **[spq AT uga DOT edu](mailto:spq@uga.edu)** is basically the same as the previous.
 - **[squinn AT apache DOT org](mailto:squinn@apache.org)** for Apache Mahout correspondence or anything open-source related.
