[insert humorous and wholly original note in blog about how blog hasn't been very active]

Life, work, travel, blah blah blah. tl;dr, [news of my untimely demise is greatly exaggerated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdf5EXo6I68).

I've been working on tweaking the layout of the site, as you can see. There's been even more going on with the underlying architecture of the site, in an effort to make my life easier. I'm still frustrated by the lack of general cooperation between Pelican and IPython/Jupyter notebook embeddings, so it's as-of-yet unclear when I'll be able to do this entirely in a Jupyter notebook.

At any rate, Cathryn and I recently paid a visit to our old stomping grounds for the purpose of [running on a marathon relay team](https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/sprinkles-are-for-winners/). We've since run in a local 5K, have registered for a 10K, and are busier than ever with work and play.

On the working side, I've submitted a couple more grant proposals and am grinding away at the "big one": a K-25 mentored grant, due June 12. Just yesterday we had a paper accepted to [ACM SIGKDD 2016](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/), so that's *super exciting*. Still waiting on two more papers we submitted to [MICCAI](http://www.miccai2016.org/); fingers crossed! In the meantime, I'm keeping busy trying to get my summer course up and running: an online version of [CSCI 1360 Foundations in Informatics and Analytics](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~squinn/courses/fa16/csci1360/).

Lots with which to stay busy! Stay tuned.
